View Fields are a powerful way to reactively display your metadata in your notes. 
They can bind to multiple frontmatter fields and update as soon as you change them, much like dataview inline queries, but with Obsidian Publish support. 
View fields can even save their computed value back to the frontmatter.

## Creating View Fields

Imagine we have a note which we use to plan an upcoming hiking trip. 
In the frontmatter we already created a field that tracks the distance in kilometers of the trip.
And we created an input field to change the distance from within our note.
It looks something like this.

````
Distance: `INPUT[number:distance]` km
````

But now we want to, for our american friends, know how long that is in freedom units. 
This is where view fields come in.

````
Distance: `INPUT[number:distance]` km
Distance in freedom units: `VIEW[{distance}]`
````

This will display the distance and change when we change the value using the input field above, but we are still missing the conversion.
At this point mathjs becomes useful. With it, we can simply convert the km into miles.

````
Distance: `INPUT[number:distance]` km
Distance in freedom units: `VIEW[number({distance} km, miles)]` miles
````

To make it a bit nicer to view, we can also round the number to two decimal places. And the displayed value still changes instantly when we change the distance using the input field.

````
Distance: `INPUT[number:distance]` km
Distance in freedom units: `VIEW[round(number({distance} km, miles), 2)]` miles
````

The references to the frontmatter in the curly brackets follow the same bind target rules as the bind target for input fields.

## View Field Types

You can also specify a view field type. The default (if you don't specify any) is <ViewFieldLink type={ViewFieldType.MATH}></ViewFieldLink>.

Specifying a view field type is done like so.

````
VIEW[content][viewFieldType]
````

This means the following two examples are equivalent. Both calculate `a` times `b`.

````
VIEW[{a} * {b}]
VIEW[{a} * {b}][math]
````

## Arguments

View fields, like input fields, support arguments to further customize them.
The syntax for them is also the same, meaning they are specified in parentheses behind the view field type.

If for example you want your <ViewFieldLink type={ViewFieldType.TEXT}></ViewFieldLink> view field to render markdown instead of plain text,
you can add the <ViewFieldArgumentLink type={ViewFieldArgumentType.RENDER_MARKDOWN}></ViewFieldArgumentLink> argument like this.

```
VIEW[**{someText}**][text(renderMarkdown)]
```

This will render the text stored in the `someText` frontmatter property as markdown.

## Saving the Value

You can save the value computed by a view field back to a frontmatter property by specifying a "write-to" bind target. See [binding to metadata](/obsidian-meta-bind-plugin-docs/guides/inputfields/#binding-to-metadata).

Let's say you want to compute a value `c` that has the value of `a * b`, in other words you want to compute `a * b` and save the result to `c`. This can be done by specifying `c` as the "write-to" bind target of the view field like so.

```
VIEW[{a} * {b}][math:c]
```

### Circular Dependencies

Of course you can abuse this and create circular dependencies that cause Obsidian to crash by doing something like the following example.

```
VIEW[{a}][math:b]
VIEW[{b + 1}][math:a]
```

Or like this.

```
VIEW[{a + 1}][math:a]
```

Meta Bind **will detect** these dependency loops and **will prevent** you accidentally locking yourself out of Obsidian and your notes.

### Limitations

View fields will only work if you have the note, in which they are located, open.

Let's say you have two notes, `NoteA` and `NoteB`.

`NoteA` looks like this.

````md
---
someInputValue: 1
someComputedValue: 2
---

Input: `INPUT[number:someComputedValue]`
Computed Value: `VIEW[{someInputValue} * 2][math:someComputedValue]`
````

And let's say you want to also change and read the values of `NoteA` in `NoteB`.

So `NoteB` looks like this.

````md
Input: `INPUT[number:NoteA#someComputedValue]`
Computed Value: `VIEW[{NoteA#someComputedValue}]`
````

If you have both notes open the view field in `NoteB` will update as expected, when you change the input value using the input field.
But if you close `NoteA` (so that only `NoteB` is open), then the view field will no longer update, since the view field that does the computation is in `NoteA` and that note is no longer loaded.

## Creating JS View Fields

The plugin also offers to create view fields with JavaScript from inside your notes. 
You can activate them in the plugins settings. 
By default, js view fields are disabled, as they can pose a security risk.

Js view fields consist of two sections. 
First the bind target section and then the JS section. 
When rendered, the JS view field displays the value returned in the JS section.

````
```meta-bind-js-view
{bind_target} as var1
{other_note#bind_target} as var2
---
return `${context.var1 * context.var2} km`;
```
````

There are multiple global variables available in the JS section.

| Name       | Description                                                                                 |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `app`      | Reference to the Obsidian app instance.                                                     | 
| `mb`       | Reference to the meta-bind api.                                                             |
| `dv`       | Reference to the dataview api, if dataview is installed and enabled.                        | 
| `filePath` | The file path of the note that is view field is in.                                         |
| `context`  | This object contains your bound metadata. Updating the values in this object has no effect. |
