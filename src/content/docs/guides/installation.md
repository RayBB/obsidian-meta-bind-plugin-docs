## Canary Builds

:::caution
Canary builds are not intended for the normal user. They are intended for testing and previewing new features.

If you are not sure if you should use canary builds, you probably shouldn't.
:::

Canary builds are builds containing under development features. They are not guaranteed to be stable.
Canary build might contain new features that are **not yet ready** and therefore might not work as expected or break.
These feature previews may introduce **breaking changes without warning**.
There is no changelog for canary builds.

You can install canary builds via [BRAT](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat).

If you don't know if you are using a canary build, you can look at the version number in the Obsidian settings.
Canary builds have a version number ending in `-canary` plus a timestamp, e.g. `0.9.0-canary.20231129T131457`.
