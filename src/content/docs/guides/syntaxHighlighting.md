description: A note on syntax highlighting for the meta bind syntax.

Meta Binds has multiple syntax for different features, and they can get confusing at times.
To aid you with understanding what is going on, Meta Bind has syntax highlighting.
This means that some elements of the syntax will be highlighted in different colors, like in the code blocks below.

```meta-bind
INPUT[slider(minValue(0), maxValue(10)):some/file#some.property]
```
