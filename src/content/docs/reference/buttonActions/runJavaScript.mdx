The run JavaScript file action runs a JavaScript file.

:::note
This requires the [JS Engine](https://github.com/mProjectsCode/obsidian-js-engine-plugin) plugin to be installed and enabled.
:::

```ts
interface JSButtonAction {
	type: 'js';
	file: string; // the path to the JavaScript file to run, relative to the vault root
  args?: Record<string, unknown>; // optional arguments to pass to the script
}
```

### Example

````custom_markdown {5-6}
```meta-bind-button
style: primary
label: Run JavaScript File
action:
  type: js
  file: someScript.js
```
````

With the following `someScript.js` file in the vault root.

```js title="someScript.js"
console.log('Hello World!');
```

You should see the string `Hello World!` printed to the console, when you click the button.
