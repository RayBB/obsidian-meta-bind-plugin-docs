Meta Bind is a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), that allows you to create input and view fields inside your notes.
Those input and view fields can then be bound to metadata fields in your notes.
The plugin features live preview support as well as Obsidian Publish support.

## Getting Started

I made a small tutorial that teaches you the basics of Meta Bind.
If you are looking for examples, you can explore the [example vault](https://github.com/mProjectsCode/obsidian-meta-bind-plugin/tree/master/exampleVault) that I use for testing.

## Bugs, Errors or Unexpected Behavior?

Please open a bug report on the plugins [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mProjectsCode/obsidian-meta-bind-plugin/issues).

## Have an Idea for a new Feature?

Feature requests and contributions are always welcome.
If you have an idea, feel free to open a feature request under the [issues tab on GitHub](https://github.com/mProjectsCode/obsidian-meta-bind-plugin/issues) or even create a pull request.
